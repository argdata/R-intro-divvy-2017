Time: 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm<br>
Location: Zar Room, John Crerar Library<br>
Instructor: Peter Carbonetto

## General Information

The [R computing environment](http://cran.r-project.org) has become
one of the most important tools in quantitative research, from
computational biology to financial modeling. This short workshop will
expose participants to the basic elements of R through an analysis of
[Divvy bike trip data](https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data). The
aim is to provide participants with the basic tools to explore the
features of R and RStudio on their own, either on the RCC cluster, or
on their own computer.

**Level:** Introductory

**Prerequistes:** No previous programming experience is required.
Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system that they have administrative
privileges on. An RCC account is helpful, but not required.

**Where:** Kathleen A. Zar Room, John Crerar Library, University of
Chicago ([OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=john%20crerar%20library#map=18/41.79053/-87.60282)).

**Additional info:** This workshop is an attempt to apply elements of
the
[Software Carpentry approach](http://software-carpentry.org/lessons);
see also
[this article](http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.3-62.v2)).

Please also take a look at the [Code of Conduct](conduct.html), and the
[license information](license.html).

The purpose of this project is to gain some insight into city-wide
biking trends by analyzing the
[Divvy trip data](https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data). Also, I
examine trip data from one bike station at the University of Chicago
to compare the biking patterns at the university against city-wide
trends.

All the results and plots presented in the pages below should be
reproduceable on your computer. Follow the
[Setup Instructions](setup.html) if you are interested in reproducing
the results for yourself.

These are the results of my analyses. They were generated by rendering
the [R Markdown documents](https://github.com/pcarbo/wflow-divvy/tree/master/analysis)
into webpages.
