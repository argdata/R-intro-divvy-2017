# Connecting to midway using a Yubikey

If you do not already have a [user account on
midway](http://rcc.uchicago.edu/getting-started/request-account), the
instructor can provide you with a
[YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/start). This will allow you to access
the RCC cluster (*midway*) for the duration of the workshop. (After
the workshop, you can request a proper user account
[here](https://rcc.uchicago.edu/getting-started/general-user-account-request)
provided you are associated with a Principal Investigator who already
has an RCC account.)

To access *midway* using the YubiKey, when prompted for your username,
enter `rccguestXXXX`, where `XXXX` is the last 4 digits shown on the
Yubikey:

Whenever a password is requested for this guest account, the password
will be automatically generated by lightly touching the metal contact:
